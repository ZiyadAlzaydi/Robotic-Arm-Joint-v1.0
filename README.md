# Robotic-Arm-Joint-v1.0
This part is a U-shaped servo or joint mounting bracket, designed to connect two segments of a robotic arm while allowing controlled rotational movement through a central axis. It is commonly used as an elbow joint or servo coupler in robotic arm assemblies.

Key Features:

U-Shaped Profile: Provides a strong and compact structure for rotational movement.

Side Holes: Two aligned holes on the vertical walls allow for a shaft, bolt, or servo horn to pass throughâ€”acting as a pivot point.

Base Holes: Multiple holes on the bottom face (probably for bolts/screws) to securely attach the bracket to a servo motor, frame, or another part.

Chamfered/Filleted Edges: Smoothed edges help reduce stress concentrations and improve strength and aesthetics.

Use Case:

This bracket is ideal for assembling the movable joints of a robotic arm. A servo motor can be placed beneath or between the U-brackets, where a horn or shaft connects through the side holes, allowing rotation of an attached link.

Design Software:

Created using Onshape CAD platform in Part Studio, and can be used in a larger Assembly for robotic arm design.
